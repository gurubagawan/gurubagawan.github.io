        In my time at SeamlessMD, I  was responsible for creating a way for providers to submit surveys on behalf of patients. 
        This was a very important feature for the company, as it allowed for a more comprehensive data set to be collected. I was the sole dev
         on this project, and worked closely with the product team to ensure that the feature was implemented correctly. Due to privacy regulations I'm not able to post 
          any screenshots of the project, but I'm happy to discuss the project in more detail.

        As part of my time at at tilr, I was responsible for a relaunch of the marketing website. The website was made to 
        draw clients for the company, and grow revenue. I was the sole dev on this project, and worked closely with my colleague 
        <a href="https://www.iamsaraef.com/"> Sara Farnell </a> , who spear headed design. This site has since been taken down, but I 
        have attached screenshots of the finished project

        <h4> Learning Points </h4>
        <p> The main learning point of this app was familiarity with Binary classification.
          This method is the main sort method behind the app, and it was very fun to learn.

            </p>
            <h4> Learning Points </h4>
            <p>The most challenging and fun part of this app was getting the logic sequence for the answer review right. It really helped solidify my knowledge of loops and conditionals.

              <h4> Learning Points </h4>
              <p>
                The GUI for this app was relatively straight forward for me to put together, however the app provided me with the perfect opportunity to learn Firebase integration.

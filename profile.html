        <p>
          I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer with a passion for healthcare and a
          love for tech. <br> <br >
          My interest in coding started in the summer of 2017 when I took a
          Web-Development Bootcamp at BrainStation Toronto. Over the course of
          10 weeks I was able to gain an in depth understanding of the
          fundamentals of web-development. This was done through daily
          lectures and weekly assignments. BrainStation really helped me with
          kickstarting my career in tech in an exciting way.<br /> <br />
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy thinking about politics, workflow
          optimization, and why Stannis Baratheon is the rightful heir to the
          Iron Throne. I also like to read, write and catch up on the latest
          entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. <br /> <br />
          Get in touch with me if you want to know more, or if you want to
          talk about why the Fellowship of the Ring was justified in not
          taking the eagles to Mordor. Unless you say jif... then we may not
          get along (kidding...sort of).
